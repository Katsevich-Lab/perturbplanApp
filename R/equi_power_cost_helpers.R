# EQUI-POWER AND EQUI-COST CURVES (Workflow 5 Specialization)

# 
# NOTE: All plotting functions have been moved to fct_plotting_functions.R
# This file is kept for backward compatibility but should be phased out.
#
# Functions that were moved:
# - create_equi_power_cost_plot()
# - generate_target_equi_power_curve()
# - generate_tangent_equi_cost_line()
# - create_standard_cost_tradeoff_plot()
