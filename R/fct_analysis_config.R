# This file previously contained workflow detection and parameter formatting
# functions that have been moved to more appropriate locations:
#
# - detect_workflow_scenario() → moved to fct_workflow_detection.R
# - get_varying_parameters() → moved to fct_workflow_detection.R
# - format_parameter_name() → moved to fct_workflow_detection.R
# - get_default_parameter_range() → deleted (unused)
#
# Additional functions were removed during cleanup:
# - use_placeholder_mode() → deleted (unused)
# - get_analysis_mode() → deleted (unused)
# - validate_workflow_config() → deleted (unused)
# - extract_parameter_range() → deleted (unused)
# - create_analysis_metadata() → deleted (unused)
#
# This file is now empty and could be deleted if no future analysis
# configuration functions are needed.
